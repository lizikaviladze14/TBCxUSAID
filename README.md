TBC Academy USAID Page Clone

## Description

This project is a clone of the [TBC Academy USAID page](https://www.tbcacademy.ge/usaid). It was built using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Sass. The aim of this project was to practice and enhance front-end development skills by replicating the structure, layout, and design of an existing webpage.

## Development Tools
- **Sass Compilation:** Utilizing VSCode's 'Watch Sass' feature for translating SCSS to CSS.
- **Local Server:** The project is served using Live Server for easy development and testing.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The clone is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Dynamic Content Loading:** The project utilizes asynchronous JavaScript and the Fetch API to dynamically load content from external sources, mimicking the behavior of the original page.

- **Sass Styling:** Stylesheets are written in Sass to take advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins, enhancing maintainability and readability of the code.
